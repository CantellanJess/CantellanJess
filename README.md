Hello, I am Jessi Cantellan, a recent Information Systems graduate passionate about using technology to make a difference. Through my internship at a legal tech startup, I have built full-stack web features, optimized performance, and collaborated with design, product, and executive teams to deliver impact in a fast-moving environment.

Also working on a startup project aimed at helping small businesses, especially in underserved communities to strengthen their digital presence. I love working on projects where I can bridge business thinking with hands-on development.

I am actively looking for opportunities where I can grow with a team whether in software development, digital operations, IT support, or startup/tech environments.

Let’s connect!
